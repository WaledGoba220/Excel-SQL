## SQL 

> Hypes or not, Big Data, NoSQL, Analytics, Business Intelligence, Data Science require processing huge amounts of data in various and complex ways using a vast array of statistical methods and tools. Market increasingly needs graduates with both databases and data warehouses technological skills and also statistical competencies in order to decipher the business patterns and trends hidden in the mountains of data. This paper presents the main coordinates of data processing today and some implications for academic curricula. It argues that data analysis and business intelligence professionals could benefit if trained to acquire a proper level of SQL and data warehouses knowledge.

## Quick overview

>- SQL for Data Analysis is a powerful programming language that helps data analysts interact with data stored in Relational databases. By using SQL several companies have built their proprietary tools to fetch information from databases quickly.

>- This data-driven approach has enabled the industry to channel its growth by analyzing meaningful information to make critical business decisions. Data Analysis has played a vital role in identifying trends and patterns as organizations forecast their business goals by extracting their historical data in databases. And,

>- This article provides you with a comprehensive overview of the importance of SQL for Data Analysis. It also explains the types of Data Analysis and the potential of SQL queries with databases, along with the limitations it possesses.

>- Data Analysis helps organizations improve their product and services to enhance customer satisfaction. The process of Data Analysis involves collecting and organizing big data to extract useful information, as it helps in making critical decisions to prosper in business, With the advent of technology, Data Analysis discovers key parameters, predicts patterns and trends, which leads to business productivity. It also adds value to business processes, as it assists in understanding the meaning behind numbers and figures by presenting an in-depth analysis.

## Types of Data Analysis

### Data Analysis requires systematically evaluating parameters through various processes. To summarize, Data Analysis can be of four different types:

- Statistical Analysis
  
- Diagnostic Analysis
  
- Predictive Analysis
  
- Prescriptive Analysis

  
##  1. Statistical Analysis

> Statistical analysis helps in describing and comparing data to uncover trends and patterns. Statistical analysis includes descriptive and inferential analysis to identify measures of central tendency and decipher inferences to get key performance indicators.

## 2. Diagnostic Analysis

> The Diagnostic analysis aims to identify the root cause of a business problem, as it involves finding positive and negative impacts of decisions taken previously. With Diagnostic analysis, organizations find the ground reality of divergence from statistical analysis.

## 3. Predictive Analysis

> Predictive analysis assists in having a prior understanding of events likely to occur by estimating trends from historical data. For instance, if a company wants to identify potential risk in business initiatives, Predictive analysis catalyzes the organization to align with the desired business goals.

## 4. Prescriptive Analysis

> The Prescriptive analysis combines insights from the above three analyses to formulate a plan of action for the organization. With Prescriptive analysis, organizations can address the possible issues with ML models that are trained with prior knowledge of strategies.


Different tools Used to Perform Data Analysis
The primary purpose of Data Analysis is to gather information, process, and derive insights to come with possible business solutions. Data Analysis with software tools have helped speed up this process, and few powerful tools are as below:

1. Python: It is the most widely used general-purpose programming language bundled with huge libraries like pandas, NumPy, and several others, helping in Data Analysis.

2. R: It is the most prominent programming language for Data Analysis that has dominated the market with powerful statistical tools.

3. SAS: Primarily used by big IT companies, Statistical Analysis System (SAS) has helped in performing complex Statistical analysis and generating Reports.

4. SQL: It is the standard programming language used to communicate with Relational databases. SQL  for Data Analysis is designed to facilitate the retrieval of specific information through simple queries from a database

## Benefits of SQL for Data Analysis
- SQL for Data Analysis is easy to understand and learn, thereby making it a user-friendly language.
- SQL for Data Analysis is efficient at fast query processing and helps in retrieving big data from multiple databases efficiently.
- SQL  for Data Analysis supports exceptional handling as it provides standard documentation to users.
